# A brief description of what your plugin is doing.
summary: This plugin for Traefik allows it to authenticate requests against an OpenID Provider. It utilizes the provider's client credentials flow to retrieve an access token, which is then set as a bearer token in the Authorization header of the incoming requests. The plugin communicates with the provider using the OpenID Connect protocol (OIDC).
